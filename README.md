# New Computer, Who Dis?

This repository contains a [Bun](https://bun.sh) powered script for bootstrapping a new computer for development.
The only supported platform (for now) is **macOS** because I'm not interested in developing with other platforms.

As usual with scripts like these, this probably won't work for you but feel free to fork and adapt it to your needs. There's no license nor warranty at all.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `bun run setup.ts`

## Further Information

Other applications (including commercial ones) I use are documented in my [**website**](https://nikoheikkila.fi/uses/).
