# New Computer, Who Dis?

This repository contains a `zx` <https://github.com/google/zx> powered script for bootstrapping a new computer for development. Eventually supported platforms are **macOS**, **Linux**, and **Windows**.

As usual with scripts like these, this probably won't work for you but feel free to fork and adapt it to your needs. There's no license nor warranty at all.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `yarn`

## Further Information

Other applications (including commercial ones) I use are documented in my [**website**](https://nikoheikkila.fi/uses/).
