# New Computer, Who Dis?

This repository contains a set of scripts to bootstrap a new computer for development. Supported platforms are:

- macOS High Sierra and newer
- Windows 10 with WSL installed

Standard Linux support will be added when I bother to start coding with one.

As usual with scripts like these, this probably won't work for you but feel free to adapt it to your needs. There's no license nor warranty at all.

## Usage

Entrypoint is `./setup.sh`. Execute it and let it roll!
